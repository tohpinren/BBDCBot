# BBDCBot
Simple booking bot built in python with Selenium. Due to the covid situation and high demand, the waiting time for simulator slots at BBDC is an average of 2 months. This bot is built to look for cancelled slots and automates the process so you don't have to navigate BBDC's slow website every time. It will auto login to BBDC's website and check for available slots every 10 minutes and it books the first available slot if the slot is within one month. Bot can be edited to book slots for BTT/FTT/practical lessons and the time range can be changed.
